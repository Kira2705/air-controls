hiya, these are just few fun codes, Main base code ain't mine, I have just improvised the existing code from outsource for my own use.

for air canvas, make sure you have 
- python
- mediapipe
- opencv
all can be easily install via cmd

for air mouse, requiremnts are
- python
- tensorflow
- pyautogui
again everything can be installed via cmd

make sure you are using correct API for those who are using newer version of mediapipe
