hiya, these are just few fun codes, Main base code ain't mine, I have just improvised the existing code from outsource for my own use.

for air canvas, make sure you have 
- python
- mediapipe
- opencv

for air mouse, requiremnts are
- python
- tensorflow
- pyautogui


make sure you are using correct API for those who are using newer version of mediapipe, and everything can be easily installed via cmd
(make sure to change the gestures lol)
